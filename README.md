- Updates css and js and html with new asides and lists. 

- Add a 6th question to the guessing game that takes in a numeric input by prompting the user to guess a number.
Indicates through an alert if the guess is “too high” or “too low”.
It should give the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer.
After all attempts have been exhausted, tell the user the correct answer. Consider using a loop of some sort.
