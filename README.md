- Updates css and js and html with new asides and lists. 

- Add a 6th question to the guessing game that takes in a numeric input by prompting the user to guess a number.
Indicates through an alert if the guess is “too high” or “too low”.
It should give the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer.
After all attempts have been exhausted, tell the user the correct answer. Consider using a loop of some sort.

- Changed css colors for asides.
- Worked on new function multGame.
- There is still a decent amount to refine and finish.
-

The CSS styling needs to be reformated to allow for proper structure. Will emplement new wireframe in the near future. 

The game with multiple answers to the question still needs to return the correct answers at the end as well as the score count.
