    <h1>About Me</h1>
  </header>
  <main>

  <p>From a young age to adulthood, I maintained a penchant for music, sound, and gadgets. This general curiosity began to bloom for me in my teen years when I started playing in bands with friends and family. Frequent jamming, extensive practice, and collecting instruments and recording devices became my life. Odd and old instruments from garage sales and thrift stores were like gold to me. I could spend hours with a dusty electric organ. The finicky but beautiful sawtooth waves of these damn near broken instruments distracted me from the monotonous hell-hole that is the suburbs of central Oklahoma.</p> 
  
  <p>Soon this innocent compulsion turned into a passion. This passion was often likened to drugs and often shared the same space. It was getting harder to fund my addiction to the sound on the meager Oklahoma minimum wage in the late aughts. I had to make drastic changes and fast. I ended up joining the United States Navy as Submarine Sonar Technician no less. It looks like my obsession could become an outright career. Which it did, but not in the ways I expected. After doing time in the Navy, I realized perhaps that kind of life wasn’t for me. The extended periods of time away from the sun, stuck in a black tube of death fathoms beneath the surface with only a guitar and a midi controller to plink around on weren’t my idea of making it in the world. Though I learned a lot in my time, I figured the outside had much more to offer with far less restriction and headache.</p> 
    
  <p>Upon leaving the service, I promptly found my way to The Academy of Contemporary Music @ the University of Central Oklahoma. Here I transitioned with great ease as Audio Engineering in the studio goes hand in hand with the tasks and skills learned previously. Why I wondered back to desolation, I could not tell you for certain, but after I completed my Associates Degree there I made a swift transition back to the great state of Washington with a handful of instruments, my dog, and a camper I built on the back on an old Toyota T-100.</p>
